Task: Given a potentially ambiguous word and some limited textual context, the task is to select, among a set of ten candidate images, the one which corresponds to the intended meaning of the target word.

This package contains the train data (v1) and the trial data (v1) for the SemEval-2023 Task-1 Visual-WSD task.

Both the training and trial folders have a directory named "train/trial_images_v1" and two files, with the same number of lines (each line corresponds to an instance):

    * train/trial.data.v1.txt: This is a tab-separated file, each line corresponds to an instance in the following format: 

        target_word <tab> full_phrase <tab> image_1 <tab> image_2 <tab> ... <tab> image_10

	    - "target_word": the potentially ambiguous target word.

   	    - "full_phrase": the textual context containing the target_word.

		- "image_i": corresponds to the "i"th image. In this version, all train/trial images are in the train/trial_images_v1 folder. 
		
	* train/trial.gold.v1.txt: This file contains the gold labels. Each line contains the name of the gold image for each corresponding data instance.


DISCLAIMER & CONTENT WARNING
The training data is automatically built and may contain noise in both text and images. Moreover, it may contain NSFW, discomforting and disturbing content.
